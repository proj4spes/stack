/**
 * This module is used to set configuration defaults for the AWS infrastructure.
 * It doesn't provide much value when used on its own because terraform makes it
 * hard to do dynamic generations of things like subnets, for now it's used as
 * a helper module for the stack.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     module "defaults" {
 *       source = "github.com/segmentio/stack/defaults"
 *       region = "us-east-1"
 *       cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
 *     }
